      <description>Amazon Web Services has recently released the Cloud Development Kit. It seemed like the idea was to expose AWS resources through a TypeScript API so that you could share your CloudFormation templates through NPM libraries, making it easier to share your work and to deploy your infrastructure. Within a few examples, I was hooked. You can follow part of my journey in the codelab workshop I created at https://aws-cdk-workshop.alvaromongil.com/#0.</description>

      <description>Lately, I have not been giving much attention to my Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and I remembered that a few months back I had received an invitation to the Storj network. Luckily, I have a spare 1TB external HDD that I can now hopefully put to good use.
 Storj is an S3-compatible platform and suite of decentralized applications that allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Alvaro, thanks for visiting my personal site!
I am currently living in Madrid, working as a Solutions Architect for BBVA Next Technologies. My job involves designing and implementing scalable, highly available distributed systems infrastructure in AWS, automating infrastructure self-service through CI/CD pipelines, and also programming orchestrating scripts and tools in Python and Go.</description>
