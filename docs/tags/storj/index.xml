      <description>Lately, I have not been giving much attention to my Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and I remembered that a few months back I had received an invitation to the Storj network. Luckily, I have a spare 1TB external HDD that I can now hopefully put to good use.
 Storj is an S3-compatible platform and suite of decentralized applications that allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner.</description>
