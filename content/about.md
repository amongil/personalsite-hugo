Hi, I'm Alvaro, thanks for visiting my personal site!

I studied [Telematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telematics) Engineering in my home country Spain. Because of that I have a broad interest within the area of technology, being Software Development, Distributed Systems, and Embedded Systems and Sensors / IoT what usually occupies my mind (and time).

In 2015 I moved to Ireland, where I had the pleasure of getting to know a unique, beautiful culture and country. At the same time, I learned tons about Data Storage working among the best at that.

I am currently living in Munich, working as a Cloud Systems Engineer. My job involves designing and implementing scalable, highly available distributed systems in AWS, serverless APIs, and also program orchestrating scripts and tools in Python and Go.
