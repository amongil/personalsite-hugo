Hi, I'm Alvaro, thanks for visiting my personal site!

I am currently living in Munich, working as a Cloud Systems Engineer. My job involves designing and implementing scalable, highly available distributed systems infrastructure in AWS, automating infrastructure self-service through CI/CD pipelines, and also programming orchestrating scripts and tools in Python and Go.
