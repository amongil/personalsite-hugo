Hi, I'm Alvaro, thanks for visiting my personal site!

I studied [Telematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telematics) at the University of Oviedo in my home country Spain. Because of my studies I have a broad interest within the area of technology, being Software Development, Distributed Systems and Embedded Systems and Sensors / IoT what usually occupies my mind (and time).

In 2015 I moved to Ireland, where I had the pleasure of getting to know a unique, beautiful culture and country. At the same time, I learned tons about Data Storage working among the best at that at EMC Information Systems.

I am currently living in Munich, working for Cloudreach as a Cloud Systems Engineer on where I use Python, AWS, various automation tools and Agile Methodologies to build Distributed Applications in the Cloud and do that thing called *DevOps*.
